# Ray Tracing with Reflection using SDL3
A real-time ray tracing simulation in C++ and SDL3 that demonstrates light reflection from a circular object. The project visualizes rays emitted from a light source, which then interact with an obstacle and reflect accordingly.

## Features
✅ Ray casting simulation with reflection

✅ Real-time rendering using SDL3

✅ Light interaction with a moving elliptical object

✅ Adjustable parameters for easy modifications
